GCC is a popular console-based compiler for *NIX platforms and others;
GCC can crosscompile code for various architectures
crosscompile means like you generate object codes 
which can be used for ARM from x86 environment

- gcc command is used to compile C programs; 
g++ command is used to compile C++ code

- GCC can compile various languages like ADA, 
Java because GCC is designed like that

- GCC performs all of these;
-- Preprocessing: processes macros
-- Compile, assembly
-- linking

GCC architecture

3 main parts: front end, middle end, back end

- front end converts source file (like C file) into the intermidiate code called Generic
if you have C++ code, C++ code is converted into the intermidiate code called Generic
Generic is similar concept with the Byte code from Java
if you have Java code, Java code is converted into the intermidiate code called Generic

It means that if you create a new language,
what you have to do is to create the intermediate module (AST)
which can convert your language source files into the Generic

# ======================================================================
In middle end, optimization steps (optimization pass1, ..., pass N) are performed

And RTL (register transfer language) is created 

# ======================================================================
RTL is converted into the machien code

# ======================================================================
Simple example of using GCC

# ======================================================================
1. Create c source file
touch hello.c

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello\n");
}

# ======================================================================
2. Compile source file
# -o: specify name of object file
# hello.c: source file name
# -g: adds symbolic information for debugging
# -Wall: prints all warning messages (very useful)
gcc -o hello hello.c -g -Wall

# ======================================================================
3. Execute program

./hello
