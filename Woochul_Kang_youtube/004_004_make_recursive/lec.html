A large project has complicated structure

======================================================================
Is it possible that you can compile above complicated-structure-project 
by using single Makefile?

It's possible if single Makefile defines all rules against all files.

But in this situation, 
Makefile becomes too complicated and becomes not manageable.

======================================================================
The solution to make above complicated situation easy is 
to use multiple Makefiles in each directory.

And each Makefile in each directory has rules 
about how to compile files in its own directory.

======================================================================
Makefiles which are located in base directories play a role of calling Makefiles 
which are located in sub directories.

And Makefiles which are located in base directories can link result files 
which are generated from sub-Makefiles

======================================================================
Makefiles which are located in more base directories play a role of calling Makefiles 
which are located in sub directories.

And Makefiles which are located in more base directories can link result files 
which are generated from sub-Makefiles or can install files.

======================================================================
This is called "recursive make".

======================================================================
# Directories which you'll use are lib and app
DIRS=lib app
# Phony targets which you'll use are all and clean
.PHONY: all clean

# all target
all:
  # Recipes for all target
  # Iterate DIRS
  @for d in ${DIRS};\
  do\
    # go to d directory, and in that directory, call Makefile
    # $d: value which is stored in variable d
    # $$d: when this Makefile hands this shell line in other Makefile
    # this Makefile should pass raw d (which is not interpreted) to other Makefile
    # $ is used as escape character
    ${MAKE} -C $$d;\
  done
  # Above line is actually one line which is concatenated by "\"
  # You can use "@" not to print @-marked-shell-line

# clean phony target
clean:
  # Recipes for clean phony target
  @for d in ${DIRS};\
  do\
    # Go to each directory, and in that directory, call make clean
    ${MAKE} -C $$d clean;\
  done
